/**
 * JQuery is the javascript library used in many places across canvas.

 * This script describes how you would change the text in the email box on the Canvas
 * Login page.  By default, the text in the box is "Email" but this script will allow you
 * to change this.  
 *
 * When implementing this script, replace <replacement> with the text you want to appear.
 * For example, you may want to have that text be "A-Number" rather than "email".
