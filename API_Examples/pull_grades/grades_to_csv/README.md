Exporting Grades to CSV
======

Canvas natively supports exporting grades in CSV format to
SIS systems. If, however, you have a need to pull grades via
the API, this example can help you get started.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
